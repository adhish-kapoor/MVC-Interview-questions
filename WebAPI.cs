//Web API can be accessed in the server side code in .NET and also on client side using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery, AnguarJS, KnockoutJS etc.
========Consume Web API in ASP.NET MVC
To consume Web API in ASP.NET MVC server side we can use HttpClient in the MVC controller. 
HttpClient sends a request to the Web API and receives a response. 
We then need to convert response data that came from Web API to a model and then render it into a view.
========Consume Web API in AngularJS
Web API can be accessed directly from the UI at client side using AJAX capabilities of any JavaScript framework such as AngularJS, KnockoutJS, Ext JS etc.
